### Scenario:
The client company is Social Buzz. Social Buzz was founded by two former engineers from a large social media conglomerate, one from London and the other from San Francisco. Social Buzz emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous, only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. There are over 100 ways that users can react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments.
They have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of an advisory firm to oversee their scaling process effectively. Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted. All of this data is highly unstructured and requires extremely sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain.
To start our engagement with Social Buzz, Accenture is running a 3 month initial project in order to prove to them that we are the best firm to work with. They are expecting the following:
- An audit of their big data practice
- Recommendations for a successful IPO
- An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity

### Dataset Summary:
The client provided 3 datasets:
- Content
